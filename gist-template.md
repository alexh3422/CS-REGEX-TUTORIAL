# REGEX CHEAT SHEET/GUIDE

This cheat sheet/guide is a useful tool that you can reference while coding. 

## Summary

This cheat sheet/guide will cover everything from Anchors to Flags and more! 

Regex (also known as Regular Expressions) can really come in handy when dealing with text such as searching through forms to make sure email addresses are formatted correct. As an example, here is the regex for that -  `/[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9-]+.+.[A-Z]{2,4}/igm`

## Regex Components

### Anchors

In Regex, ANCHORS are special characters that are used to match patterns at specific positions in the input string. The two most common ANCHORS are the caret " ^ " and the dollar sign " $ ". The caret matches the start of a string, and the dollar sign matches the end of a string. 

EXAMPLE: the regex pattern "^hello" will match any string that starts with "hello", while the pattern "world$" will match any string that ends with "world".
